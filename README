This is my second iterations for this project

I tried to do the first one with a noSql database which stores message and sort them with timestamp

The second solution is based on rabbiMq messaging server which I found quite a perfect suite for this

The http server keeps track in memory for subscriptions and create a queue for each subscriptions
